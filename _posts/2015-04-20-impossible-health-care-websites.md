Today I tried to sign-up for health insurance at 3 sites.  I don't need anything fancy, just minimum coverage so that I can cover my ass while I get this new start-up off the ground.  What happened?  Fail after bloody fail.

## Strike 1

First site I tried was Kaiser Permanente. I found their online quote competitive and recognized the name.  Figured it would go smooth. NOT.  My effective date was 1 month too late.  So, I restarted a new application hoping to resolve it, but no.  Still wrong.  Picked-up the phone and was surprised that customer services reps were fielding phone calls at 9 pm on a Monday night.  After being transferred several times and quizzed over and over, I stopped at sharing my SSN and hung-up.  One down.

## Strike 2

I then went to Covered CA site.  Surely the government has a system to proxy all my data securely and realiably.  Nope.  Created an account, charged through their enrollment process and then full stop with:

> The Federal Data Services Hub is not accessible at this time to confirm your identity. Please come back later to finish your application.

Okay, this is a tell tale sign of a robust system. NOT. Abandon ship there as well.

## Strike 3

Moved on to third provider: Health Net.  They have a "Net" in the name, they must know how to run a website?  This proved to be more wishful thinking.  After enrolling, they display a page with my password in plain-text.  The password clearly wasn't hashed when saved in the database. Face palm. For style points I screen shot it and blur it for posting to [plaintextoffenders.com](http://plaintextoffenders.com/).  At least I get Internet nerd credit for enduring the first half of the process.  I know all the healthcare companies disrespect my privacy. I charge onward knowing I can't do any better.

As part of the process, I need to upload a document stating my termination of benefits.  Fine, reasonable request.  However, they find clever ways to surprise me as the site replies with:

> Error : Sorry, but the file Resignation Exit Checklist.signed.pdf should not have any spaces in the file name

I'm sorry, are you kidding me?  This is a new level of incompetence.  I remove the spaces and throw it over the wall again awaiting my next surprise which has not yet come.

## Conclusion

My personal information has been put in the hands of the most incompetent set of sites I have ever visited.  It will surely be stolen.  When it's stolen, I can be certain that nobody will ever know as these clowns won't even know their security was breached since they can't even handle a file upload with spaces in it. FML.
