Background
----------
Somewhere along the way my backups stopped working when I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04.  I don't understand what exactly changed as the backup script is the same and I'm pretty sure I was using gnome-keyring-daemon as my gpg-agent.

I use [obnam](http://liw.fi/obnam/bugs) from remote back-ups and it works great.  Every night it copies the delta from the last back-up to [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?685097) [Personal Backup](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Personal_Backup) and encrypts my data on the fly.  In the event my apartment burns down I'll have my most important data.  The rest of my data is backed-up using rsync to another local harddrive which is considerably cheaper and significantly faster.

Troubleshooting
---------------

My cron scripts started complaining, so I began my investigation with a simple obnam command.  This command is supposed to list all my backups on the remote server after it decrypts the remote metadata locally.  However it failed after I took a while guess that an empty or unset <code>$DISPLAY</code> environmental variable would trip it up:

	$ DISPLAY="" obnam generations
	Host key fingerprint is 0e:c2:f6:f4:d9:86:9d:4b:c4:3d:77:e7:a4:bb:59:14

Next step was to try gpg standalone in a terminal with DISPLAY set and then unset.

	$ echo "test" | gpg -ase --batch --default-key 0x4437655D -r 0x4437655D | gpg

Okay, so it's not an obnam invocation problem or something from cron other then DISPLAY seems to break everything.  Lets see what strace tells us:

	$ echo "test" | DISPLAY="" strace -vo strace.log gpg -ase --batch --default-key 0x4437655D -r 0x4437655D
	gpg: problem with the agent - disabling agent use

	gpg: Invalid passphrase; please try again ...
	gpg: can't query passphrase in batch mode
	gpg: no default secret key: bad passphrase
	gpg: [stdin]: sign+encrypt failed: bad passphrase

And the strace output is in strace.log:

	...

Note the "**ERR 113 Server Resource Problem.**" response from the gpg-agent.  That seems odd doesn't it?

Next lets compare a working strace (with DISPLAY set) and one without, diff and we see the following:

	 socket(PF_FILE, SOCK_STREAM, 0)         = 7
	 connect(7, {sa_family=AF_FILE, path="/run/user/nitro/keyring-FUvSXm/gpg"}, 36) = 0
	 read(7, "OK your orders please\n", 1002) = 22
	  | 00000  4f 4b 20 79 6f 75 72 20  6f 72 64 65 72 73 20 70  OK your  orders p |

	-ioctl(0, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or TCGETS, 0x7fffb7a69230) = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device)
	+write(7, "OPTION display=:0.0", 19)     = 19
	+ | 00000  4f 50 54 49 4f 4e 20 64  69 73 70 6c 61 79 3d 3a  OPTION d isplay=: |

	+write(7, "\n", 1)                       = 1
	+ | 00000  0a                                                .                 |
	+read(7, "OK \n", 1002)                  = 4
	+ | 00000  4f 4b 20 0a                                       OK .              |
	+ioctl(0, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or TCGETS, 0x7fff847e57e0) = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device)
	 write(7, "OPTION ttyname=/dev/tty", 23) = 23
	  | 00000  4f 50 54 49 4f 4e 20 74  74 79 6e 61 6d 65 3d 2f  OPTION t tyname=/ |
	  | 00010  64 65 76 2f 74 74 79                              dev/tty           |

Clearly the working one passes a "**OPTION display=:0.0**" to the server.  Why should the server care what the display is if the key is already unlocked and doesn't need to pop-up a passphrase entry dialog?

Since I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 and that uses gnupg v3.6.3, lets look at the source code.  In [gkd-gpg-agent-ops.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-keyring/tree/daemon/gpg-agent/gkd-gpg-agent-ops.c?id=3.6.3#n751) we can see why it doesn't work.  We need to set <code>$DISPLAY</code> correctly in-order for <code>call->terminal_ok</code> to be set.  Otherwise, if <code>call->terminal_ok</code> isn't set, it breaks like I've observed.

Solutions
---------

This leaves me with a few options:
1. Forge <code>export DISPLAY=:0.0</code> in my cron script to dodge this pointless "security" check
2. Patch the code so it isn't silly
3. Use gnupg-agent which doesn't behave silly like this

In the interest of simplicity, I picked 1 and added one line to my backup script.  And life goes on.

Part of me still wonders why this broke when I upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04, this should have affected earlier versions of Ubuntu looking at the change log for gkd-gpg-agent-ops.c.
